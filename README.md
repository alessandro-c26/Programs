# General Purpose Programs
This repository contains a list of programs that I developed to solve various problems:

### 1 - Grader-group.py - Grade individuals after their groupwork
This Program takes as input the number of students, the number of students for group, their names and the group grades and gives as output all the possible group combinations and the individualized grades.

### 2 - Palindrome.py - Check if a word is a palindrome
This software checks if the word is a palindrome or not.

### 3 - WordCloud.py - Create WordClouds from Wikipedia articles
This program takes an URL from an article on Wikipedia and produces a WordCloud as an output.

### 4 - Webscraper.py - Create a table with around 2000 recipes automatically "scraped" from a website
This program scrapes an italian culinary website where recipes are organized in pages (10 recipes/page) and produces a table with around 2000 recipes.

### 5 - Weekly_plan.py - Generate a weekly plan from a list of 2000 recipes and print a list
This program uses the output of Webscraper.py to create a weekly table with 7 random recipes to prepare.
